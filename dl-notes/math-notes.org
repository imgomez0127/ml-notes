* Linear algebra
** Scalars vectors matrices
- scalar \(R^{1*1}\)
- vector \(R^{n*1}\)
- matrix \(R^{m*n}\)
- Tensor > 3 dim
** Multiplying vectors/matrices
- Operation is self explanatory will just list properties
- Distributive
- Associative
- transpose of the product is the product of both matrices transposed
- \((AB)^T = B^TA^T\)
** Inverse and Identity
- Identity maps each vector to itself.
- the inverse of a matrix is \(A*A^{-1}=I\)
** Linear dependence
- For the inverse to exist we must have exactly one solution for \(b\)
- The other case is that there are infinitely or no solutions
- We can view this as each column in the column space mapping to a direction from the origin where each value of b is a scaling term. (linear combination)
- The span is the set of all vectors that can be reached using a linear mapping
- Thus to determine if \(Ax=b\) has a solution we need to test if b is in the column space or range of A (column space is the span of the columns of a set of vectors)
- Therefore to have an inverse we need the column space of A to include all of \(R^m\)
- Thus A must be a wide/square matrix (n >= m) to have a solution for all b
- Intuitively if we have a 3x2 matrix we cannot model all of \(R^m\) because we only map a 2D space thus there is only a solution on the 2D plane
- however, n >= m does not ensure that there exists a solution. Due to linear dependence
- The dimensionality of the span goes down due to linear dependence e.g. 2x2 has a span of a line if the other column is linearly dependent
- thus we need there to be at least one set of exactly m linearly independent columns
- To ensure an inverse we need n = m thus we need a square matrix with n linearly independent columns (since if n > m we can have multiple solutions) this is known as *singular*
** Special kinda of matrices
- Diagonal matrices are matrices which only have non-zero numbers on the diagonal
- Diag(v) where v is a vector is the matrix with v as the diagonal
- the good thing is that diag(v)*x is an elementwise product of the two vectors v and x
- The inverse of a diagonal matrix is 1/v
- not all diagonal matrices are square
- A symmetric matrix is when A = A.T
- a uint vector is a vector with a unit L2 norm (unit = 1)
